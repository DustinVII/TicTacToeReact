## Tic Tac Toe React
<img src="git-assets/cover.png">

As part of my Software Engineering course in year 1, semester 2 at UNASAT (University of Applied Sciences and Technology Suriname) I had to build a [Tic Tac Toe game in Java](https://github.com/DustinVII/TicTacToe). I decided to recreate this game in React in order to learn the basics of React.


## Steps and requirements
Take the following steps to play this game or work on this project.

### Method 1 (fastest)
1. Upload the project on a local web server.
2. Run `index.html` in your browser.


### Method 2
1. Install `node.js`. [Download node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Check node version in command using `node -v`
3. You will need an IDE to run this, I prefer [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
4. Finally, pull this project into [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and run it.
